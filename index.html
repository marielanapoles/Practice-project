      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>During that time in highschool, I was fond in the process of creating and drawing beautiful infrastructure so I decided, why not become an Architect? Unfortunately because of some reasons, I wasn't able to pursue that career.</p>
      <p>Long story gone short, I ended up gaining CCNA Certificates from my previous university. I like working with the CLI in packet tracer without realizing my love for coding. When I was in the middle of designing my IT Capstone, and doing some research, web development just hit me hard and Ive realized that I could create and build beautiful things for people in this field, just like when I was in high school.</p>

    <section class="content 2">
      <h2>Why am I Doing This?</h2>
      <p>My teacher in Treehouse says it is good to practice what Ive learned in Treehouse and that I should practice coding not just watching their videos. Also, I want to see if I full understand the concept of CSS and I want to apply it by creating small projects like this. </p>
      <p>Note: I am  streaming Winner's Love Me Love Me on Melon while I am coding. LMLM is a very nice song which helps me stay attentive while coding. Check LMLM M/V <a href="#">here</a> </p>
