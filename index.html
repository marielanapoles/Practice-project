      <h2>Why am I Doing This?</h2>
      <p>My teacher in Treehouse says it is good to practice what Ive learned in Treehouse and that I should practice coding not just watching their videos. Also, I want to see if I full understand the concept of CSS and I want to apply it by creating small projects like this. </p>
      <p>Note: I am  streaming Winner's Love Me Love Me on Melon while I am coding. LMLM is a very nice song which helps me stay attentive while coding. Check LMLM M/V <a href="#">here</a> </p>
